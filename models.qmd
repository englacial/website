# What is this?

This is a visualization tool for exploring and
comparing model outputs from the Ice Sheet Model Inter-comparison Project for
CMIP6 (ISMIP6). [ISMIP](https://www.ismip.org/) is an international
collaborative effort to compare the behavior of ice sheet models under a
standardized set of experiments. This tool is not affiliated with ISMIP -- it's
just a visualizer of publicly-available ISMIP6 outputs, which are [hosted here on
source.coop](https://source.coop/englacial/ismip6).

The tool is a prototype article for a larger push we're working on to build
backend infrastructure for model-data comparisons. If you're interested in that,
feel free to check back here as we add more information or reach out to either
shane.grigsby@astera.org or thomas.teisberg@astera.org.

We hope this tool is useful and interesting to the scientific community. If you
find it useful or you find issues, we encourage you to email us or [open an
issue](https://github.com/englacial/ismip-indexing/issues/new).

## More about ISMIP6 and the context behind these models

This tool visualizes only model outputs from the ISMIP6 Antarctica ensemble for
now. The general structure of those experiments is described [on the ISMIP6
wiki](https://theghub.org/groups/ismip6/wiki/MainPage/ISMIP6ProjectionsAntarctica).
For details, please read the [ISMIP6 Antarctica results
paper](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/3033/2020/) in *The Cryosphere*.

## Open Source

This tool is open source, and consists of two components: a front end viewer,
and a back-end connection to the virtualized dataset. Both of these components
are client side and run fully within your browser. Visit the [ismip-viewer
repository](https://github.com/englacial/ismip-viewer) to contribute or report
issues related to the viewer, or the [icechunk-js
library](https://github.com/earth-mover/icechunk) to contribute or report
issues to the icechunk client.

# Getting started

Feel free to play around with the [dedicated viewer](/static/models/) where you
can add panels to compare models or experiments side-by-side, or just explore a
single dataset at a time. The viewer panels are embeddable using
[MyST](https://mystmd.org) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org) (or directly using
an iframe); we've done that below with a few example comparisons we think are
interesting.

## Subglacial temperature

* **Variable:** `litempbotgr` -- Basal temperature beneath grounded ice sheet (K)
* **Models:** AWI/PISM1, DOE/MALI, LSCE/GRISLI2, NCAR/CISM
* **Experiment:** exp05

There are few direct measurements of the temperature profile within or beneath
ice sheets. As a result, basal temperature (temperature at the ice-bedrock
interface) is poorly constrained. Models resolve a wide range of temperatures,
ranging from deeply frozen to at or near the pressure melting point.

## Grounding line retreat and sub-ice shelf melt

* **Variable:** `libmassbffl` -- Basal mass balance flux beneath floating ice (kg m^-2^ s^-1^)
* **Model:** DOE/MALI
* **Experiments:** exp05, exp07

`libmassbffl` shows the melt rates under floating ice shelves. It's a good way
to look at a major component of Antarctic mass loss and also visualize grounding
line retreat. Experiments 5 and 7 represent the same assumptions but with
different climate forcings. `exp05` is a high-emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) while
`exp07` is a low-emission scenario (RCP 2.6).

This is a good comparison to zoom in on, play with the time slider to see how
grounding lines evolve over time, and to use the color scale options as needed.

## Surface mass balance

* **Variable:** `acabf` -- Surface mass balance flux (kg m^-2^ s^-1^)
* **Models:** DOE/MALI, AWI/PISM1
* **Experiments:** exp05, exp07

Surface mass balance refers to the net accumulation and ablation occurring at
the surface of an ice sheet. In most of Antarctica, this primarily means "how
much snow is falling?" Antarctica is huge, so small differences in snowfall over
big areas can make an enormous difference. Patterns of surface mass balance
change over time and vary with the selected climate forcing, so be sure to
explore the time slider and look at differences between the low-emission
(`exp07`) and high-emissions (`exp05`) experiments.
