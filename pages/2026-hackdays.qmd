### Overview

The *Building Open Connected Scientific Data Products for the Cryosphere* hackdays will take place **April 13--15, 2026** in **Berkeley, CA**. The workshop is hosted by [Englacial](https://englacial.org) and [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/), with support from [Astera](https://astera.org/).

We invite you to participate in figuring out the right patterns for creating connected scientific data products as software. We want to see prototypes of derived data products that are created with the tools of open-source software and built in ways that make it possible to re-mix, replicate, and update them.

This workshop brings together scientists, data providers, open source engineers, and other experts to collaboratively explore how to build open and connected scientific data products. We’ll explore new tools and publishing alternatives for today’s changing science landscape, while we design and co-create for a future where results are available faster and reproducing and building on the work of others is easier. We welcome scientists and engineers with an interest in the cryosphere to come exchange ideas and tools for building dynamic links between data and models through open source software. Travel support will be provided to non-local participants.

### What to expect

The workshop will provide time and space for attendees to form small groups and work on building prototypes of connected data products.
The first day will feature some brief invited demos and some structured team-finding exercises. Most of days 2 and 3 will be unstructured time to work with your new teams.
Day 3 will conclude with time for teams to briefly present their projects and non-traditional artifacts for sharing science.

### Goals

* Bring together observationalists, modellers, and engineers to exchange ideas and tools for building dynamic links between data and models through open-source software
* Foster conversations around how to scale, share, and publish open science in a post-journals world
* Promote awareness of existing open-source tools for data access, analysis, and sharing

### Invited demos

Instead of traditional talks, we'll feature invited demos -- interactive demonstrations by leaders in open science showcasing tools and data products they have built.

The _Daily Showcase_ is an informal opportunity to present about a connected data product you've been working on, share thoughts from
what your team is working on, or ask for help with something you're stuck on.
